Central European chars in latin2 (cp1250, pl2) and TeX encoding

The most of Central European accented characters are defined,
also in TeX encoding. Changing encoding between these codes. I used to work
with:

- 'digraphs', but not all CTRL-K {char1} {char2} work the way that I want;
  it does not work in command-line mode and in search also.
- 'keymap' (see 'loadkeymap') but it does not works to me anyway, and in
  $vim/keymap/accents.vim there are no all CZ, HU and SK chars from
  mentioned encodings (I think there are just East European characters).
  
This 'keymap' shows more MSWord "compatibility" for Central Europe (I
think), for those who works half-time with Word it is very useful :-) 

Usage: Use [=+:;.,^] + <char> to write an accented character: <char> with
acute, ve, etc.

- <leader>at - convert the file from accents to TeX and map TeX deadkeys
- <leader>ta - convert the file from TeX to accents and map accent dedakeys
- <leader>da - map accent dedakeys
- <leader>dt - map TeX deadkeys
- <leader>du - unmap deadkeys

<leader> is usually a '\&#039
